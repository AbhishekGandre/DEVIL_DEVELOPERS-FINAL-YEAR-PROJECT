<h3>This Toolkit Containing following Application:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Mr. Anonymity checker</li>
<li>Mr. Steganography</li>
<li>Mr. Wordlister</li>
<li>Mr. Cryptographer</li>
<li>Mr. Trapper</li>
<li>Mr. Breach Checker</li>

<h1>Project Layout</h1>
Working of system
There are 3 technologies we used in our project 
1.	Front-end
2.	Backend
3.	File structure
In front-end we have used CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), JavaScript, and Html. The front panel of our project is mainly based on dynamic JavaScript and its framework and CSS.  
In The backend of our project, we used versions 4 and 5 of PHP. Python version of 3.10.4

1.	Mr. Anonymity Checker: - The tool Anonymity Checker shows the IP address of our internet connection and it shows the current location of our using IP Address
This tool is amazing, it gives the correct Ip address and Location


2.	Mr. Stegenographer: - In this tool we can encrypt and decrypt the Image file. We can hide any text behind the image text hides behind the pixels and hide the text in it 
 
 
3.  Mr. Wordlist: - In the wordlist it can make the list of all combinations of the alphabets and number systems and it make the txt file. Then you can make the brute force attack on any file or any website to crack their passwords 

4.	Mr. Cryptographer: - In the cryptographer we can encrypt and decrypt the text using various encryption types just like Sha-512 and Sha-256 thire are many algorithms to encrypt and decrypt words
 
5.	Mr. Trapper: - in Mr. Trapper there are 20+ templates for a phishing attack and to get login info of the users. The following templates just like Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest as well 
 
6.	Mr. Breach Checker: - In this tool, we integrate the API of have I been pwned and integrated the API to get the data from the server and the check the following commands and the following the heck the data breach checker we should provide the email id and the breach checker checks the database of have I been pwned and if the data breach happens then it shows the database
 
In The storage pattern, we used the file structure model 
7. Project Layout
Any digital project at a root level is divided in two part 
1.	Frontend 
2.	Backend 
Frontend covers all the parts which is visible to the user, I. e., it deals with the client side. Anything happen on a user side of the connection can be received or manipulated by the user. It concerns mostly with the user interface and experience of the application. How the structure is represented to the user is the primary goal of the frontend 
Simplicity, accessibility, proper user experience, clarity of the action and feedback are some of the basic features which play viral role in the best possible frontend 

 

Technologyâ€™s we used 
1.	HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
2.	CSS (cascading style sheet)
3.	Java script
4.	Bootstrap 
5.	Php 
6.	Python

1)	HTML is a markup language which is used for defining the structure of the website. With the tags of HTML, we build the overall structure of the frontend. Also, with the help of HTML we connect all the CSS file and JavaScript file.

2)	CSS is mainly use for styling of the frontend. In CSS we used an particular library called as Bootstrap. We covered all three useable pattern of CSS which is inline CSS internal CSS and external CSS. For font styling we also used an font awesome toolkit for spatial font. We also used @media query to create an moving elements in frontend.
 
3)	JavaScript is mainly use for creating application interactive and dynamic. pure JavaScript is mandatory for frontend dev. In JavaScript there are many libraries and predefine function which we used in our project. We also used a library called as jQuery. The purpose of jQuery is to make is much easier to use JavaScript on your application. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish.

4)	Bootstrap is use to design application with some predefine classes. Writing code from the scratch is very long process so we use some predefine classes which is provided by the bootstrap. There are two methods use to connect bootstrap with your code one is the CDN link and another is by downloading the Bootstrap library. We used offline Bootstrap because of the speed efficiency. Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, button, tables, navigation, modals, image, carousels, and it also gives you support for JavaScript plugins.

5)	PHP is used to create main backend of this project. With php we connect all the files with the main backend. We queried our data from the PHP in a JSON format. In second step, we used jQuery to make an ajax call to this PHP file. The backend interacts with frontend, sending and receiving information to be displayed. Whenever a user clicks on run button which is placed at the bottom of the block the main frontend sends a request to the exe file of that application this is done with the onclick event, every tool in this toolkit uses different language as their backend like java python and JavaScript. So the work of connecting is all is done by the PHP 

6)	Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small- and large-scale projects.

Our frontend is basically divided in three parts first is header, second is body which holds all the main application of this project and the third is footer. 
 

At the top of the main page there is glob present at the right corner, then at the left there is our logo and name which is cyber security tool kit. 

 
Then there is the body section in our front page which include 8 block and each block contain one application in it. 

 

Then at the bottom of the page there are three section which include help desk page source and credits page.
                    When you click on help desk section then it redirects to another page. This section is separately created for the new users if they are finding any difficulty using our toolkit then the can refer to the video which includes the procedure that how they can use our tool, those videos will be uploaded on YouTube and by the time the click on any of application it will redirect to the YouTube.
